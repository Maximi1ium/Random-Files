Maximi1ium Remix:

Changes:

		Simple version - this version of Space Ace plays like Dragon's Lair - no Cadet, Ace or Captain difficulty levels.

		All movements check frame by frame for accuracy, made changes to replicate original arcade experience.

		Alternative movements added.

		Some levels now divided into "scenes" - so player do not have to play the entire level after death.

		Level mirror function bug breaks scene continuity - changes made to the script file to fix issue.

		Game-Play change - Now Dexter choices affect next level, play Level as default or mirror.

		Scoreboard now updates after each move.

		Edited Borf sound on last level - ogg file included.

		Made Bezels + Bat Files, Scoreboard rdy.

Issues:

		Original Singe video - mirror scenes have reverse text.

		2 Player mode breaks the original game looks, score bezel doesnâ€™t work for a 2nd player.

		space_ace.ini file included changes action button to space bar, disable 2nd Player key.
